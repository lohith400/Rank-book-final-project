            <h1>HTML</h1>
            <p>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the backbone of the web. It's a markup language used for creating web pages and web applications. HTML provides the structure and content of a web page by using a system of tags and attributes.</p>
            <p>HTML is not a programming language but rather a markup language, meaning it defines the structure and layout of a web page rather than its behavior. However, when combined with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling and JavaScript for interactivity, HTML forms the core technologies for building dynamic and visually appealing web experiences.</p>
